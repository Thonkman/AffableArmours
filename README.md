# Affable Armours!
The mod that adds a few alternatives to netherite for end game armours. I made this mod because I felt like the turtle shell could use some friends (with unique names) and other options for armour at the later stages of progression, with their own unique utilities. Plus there also exists an entire turtle shell material in the vanilla code!
## Additions

Adds a full set to support the turtle shell.
Turtle Carapace (Chest plate)

Having all four items equipped (including turtle shell) gives you Essence of the Turtle Master.

### Phantom Set
Adds a set based around controlling the flight of the elytra
